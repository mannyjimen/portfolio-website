                Hey, I'm Manuel (but my friends call me manny)
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm a 21 y/o aspiring Software Developer.
                I am currently in my last year of university at CUNY: Hunter College 
                studying computer science, and I 
                work part-time at JD Sports as a sales associate!

            </div>
            <p>
                currently, i am learning about compiler design (pretty much making a compiler) and am really enjoying it!
                i also love the whole idea of algorithm design and thinking problems through. from a young age i loved math
                so this isn't that much of a surprise. low-level/back-end topics peak my interest, but am open to exploring what the world
                of front-end has to offer too!
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                i love playing and watching soccer (<strong style="color: rgb(250,100,100);">arsenal</strong> fan)!
                i also enjoy reading manga and listening to lots of music (my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/uzinotskrillex" target="_blank" style="color:lightgreen">spotify</a>)
