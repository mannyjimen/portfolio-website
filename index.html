                Hey, I'm Manuel (but my friends call me manny)
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm a 22 y/o aspiring Software Developer.
                I am currently in my last year of university at CUNY: Hunter College 
                studying computer science, and I 
                work part-time at JD Sports as a sales associate!

            </div>
            <p>
                currently, i am diving into computer vision , compiler/interpreter design, and concurrency. i also love the whole idea of algorithm design and thinking problems through.

            <p>
                i love playing and watching soccer (<strong style="color: rgb(250,100,100);">arsenal</strong> fan)!
                i also enjoy reading manga and listening to lots of music (my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/uzinotskrillex" target="_blank" style="color:lightgreen">spotify</a>)
                i used to play a lot of video games - not so much anymore - but my some of my favorites are counter-strike and any of the dark souls games!

            </div>
            <p>creating an interpreter for the lox programming language following Bob Nystrom's book <em>Crafting Interpreters</em>.
            contains hand-written lexer, pratt parser, and an execution engine that executes statements from the ast produced by the parser.
            </p>
            <p>
                this is the first project i did outside of class on my own, and i am very happy i did! aside from the compiler theory, i discovered very fascinating
                oop design techniques, like the visitor pattern and why oop can be bad in some cases. separating concerns is something i never thought
                about before this project, any it makes sense for larger scale projects why things like this are so important.
