                hey, im manuel (but my friends call me manny)
            </p>
            <p>
                i am a 22 y/o aspiring software engineer.
                currently in my last year of university at hunter college 
                studying computer science, and i
                work part-time at jd sports as a sales associate!

            <p>
                currently, i am diving into computer vision , compiler/interpreter design, and concurrency. i also love the whole idea of algorithm design and thinking problems through.

                i love playing and watching soccer (<strong style="color: rgb(155, 0, 0);">arsenal</strong> fan)!
                i also enjoy reading manga and listening to lots of music (my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/uzinotskrillex" target="_blank" style="color:rgb(3, 168, 3)">spotify</a>)
                i used to play a lot of video games - not so much anymore - but my some of my favorites are counter-strike and any of the dark souls games!

            </div>
            <p>creating an interpreter for the lox programming language following Bob Nystrom's book <em>Crafting Interpreters</em>.
            contains hand-written lexer, pratt parser, and an execution engine that executes statements from the ast produced by the parser.
            </p>
            <p>
                this is the first project i did outside of class on my own, and i am very happy i did! aside from the compiler theory, i discovered very fascinating
                oop design techniques, like the visitor pattern and why oop can be bad in some cases. separating concerns is something i never thought
                about before this project, any it makes sense for larger scale projects why things like this are so important.

            </div>
            <p>this was supposed to be a class project, but i took it upon myself to 'attempt' to structure everything myself, and it was very... eye-opening.
            this is entirely a simulator of an operating system, which contains priority-scheduling for processes, fcfs i/o queue, worst-fit ram management,
            and mock system calls (fork, wait, exit).
            </p>
            <p>
                created a separate class for each 'component', but this turned out pointless as i just made all the components
                grab what they needed from each other component whenever it was convenient, and there was no structuring when it came to 
                modifying data. learned that i should probably plan a project before diving into it directly.
